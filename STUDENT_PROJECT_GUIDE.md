# RAG Group Project Guide

## Welcome! 👋

Your team is about to build a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system - an AI that can answer questions about YOUR documents. This is the same technology used by ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and other AI assistants!

**This is a GROUP PROJECT:** Work in teams of 3 students. Collaboration is expected and encouraged!

---

## What Your Team Will Build

A question-answering system that:
1. Reads your documents
2. Breaks them into smaller chunks
3. Finds relevant information when you ask a question
4. Uses an AI to generate accurate answers

**Example:**
- You provide: School policy documents
- You ask: "What are the parking rules?"
- System: Searches documents → Finds relevant sections → Generates answer

---

## What You'll Learn (Python Fundamentals)

### Core Skills You'll Practice:

✅ **File I/O** - Reading documents from your computer  
✅ **String Manipulation** - Splitting and processing text  
✅ **Functions** - Writing reusable code  
✅ **Lists & Dictionaries** - Organizing data  
✅ **Loops** - Processing multiple items  
✅ **Conditionals** - Making decisions in code  
✅ **Basic Math** - Calculating metrics  

### What's Pre-Built for You:

✅ Embedding model (converts text to numbers)  
✅ Vector database (stores and searches)  
✅ LLM connection (generates answers)  

❓**Why** These use complex libraries that would take weeks to learn. We want you to focus on Python fundamentals first!

---

## Project Files

### Files You'll Use:
1. **`rag_helpers.py`** - Pre-built library code (DON'T MODIFY)
2. **`student_rag_project.ipynb`** - Your main notebook (COMPLETE THE TODOs)
3. **Your documents** - Add your own text files to test with

### Files You'll Create:
1. Test questions dataset
2. Evaluation results
3. Final report

---

## Getting Started  

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Make sure your team has:
- Anaconda or Miniconda installed
- Python 3.13+ (comes with Anaconda/Miniconda)
- VSCode
- Docker Desktop installed and running

Create the conda environment:
- 📜 Refer to **rag_env_starter.md**

### Step 2: Prepare Your Documents

1. Create a folder for your documents (e.g., `my_docs/`)
2. Add 5-10 text files (.txt format)
3. Choose a topic you know well (makes testing easier!)

**Document Ideas:**
- Course notes or textbooks
- Technical documentation
- Company policies
- Sports rules
- Recipes
- Historical documents
- Anything with factual information!

**Requirements:**
- At least 5 documents
- Minimum 1000 words total
- Plain text format (.txt)

### Step 3: Open the Student Notebook

1. Open `student_rag_project.ipynb`
2. Read through the entire notebook first
3. Look for sections marked `# TODO:`

### Step 4: Complete the TODOs

Work through each TODO section in order. Each one builds on the previous:

---

## Debugging Help

### "No documents loaded"
- Check your folder path is correct
- Make sure files are .txt format
- Check file encoding (should be UTF-8)

### "List index out of range"
- Probably an empty list somewhere
- Add checks: `if my_list:` before accessing items

### "LLM connection failed"
- Is Docker running? Check with `docker ps`
- Is Ollama accessible? Try `curl http://127.0.0.1:11434`
- Did you start the container? See docker_commands.md

### "Chunks are empty"
- Check your chunking logic
- Make sure `chunk_size` is reasonable (100-1000)
- Verify you're slicing strings correctly

### Jupyter Kernel Crashes
- Embedding model might be too large
- Restart kernel and run cells in order
- Make sure you have enough RAM

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use documents in other languages?
**A:** Yes! But make sure your embedding model supports it. The default model works best with English.

### Q: How many documents do I need?
**A:** Minimum 5, but 8-12 is better for testing.

### Q: How should we divide the work in our group?
**A:** See the "Group Work & Responsibilities" section below. Each member should contribute to coding, testing, and documentation. Recommended split: 1 person per TODO or rotate responsibilities.

### Q: What if my answers are wrong?
**A:** That's okay! Analyze WHY in your report. Did it retrieve wrong chunks? Is the prompt unclear?

### Q: How do I know if my chunk size is good?
**A:** Experiment! Try 200, 500, and 1000. See which gives better answers.

### Q: Can I modify `rag_helpers.py`?
**A:** No, that's pre-built code. Focus on completing the TODOs.

### Q: My evaluation is slow. Is that normal?
**A:** Yes! The LLM takes time. Expect 3-5 seconds per question.

### Q: Can I add extra features?
**A:** Yes! After completing all TODOs, feel free to experiment. Document extras in your report.
