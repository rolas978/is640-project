Cheating and Academic Integrity Rules

1. Definition: Cheating includes copying answers, using unauthorized materials, or allowing others to copy work. Plagiarism is also considered cheating.
2. Consequences: First offense results in a zero on the assignment and a parent notification. Second offense leads to suspension and notation on the student’s record.
3. Collaboration: Students may work together only when permitted by the teacher. Otherwise, all work must be done individually.
4. Technology Use: Using phones, smartwatches, or online tools to gain unfair advantage during assessments is strictly prohibited.
5. Reporting: Students who witness cheating are encouraged to report it confidentially to a teacher or counselor.
6. Academic Honesty: Upholding integrity is a shared responsibility. Cheating undermines trust and the value of education.
